					<p>The HTML <head> element is used as a container for metadata (data about data). It is used between <html> tag and <body> tag.

The head of an HTML document is a part whose content is not displayed in the browser on page loading. It just contains metadata about the HTML document which specifies data about the HTML document.

An HTML head can contain lots of metadata information or can have very less or no information, it depends on our requirement. But head part has a crucial role an HTML document while creating a website.
